```typescript
// Form-specific state in components
const [forms, setForms] = useState<Form[]>([]);
const [answers, setAnswers] = useState<Record<string, any>>({});
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

// API state management with custom hooks (future)
const { data: forms, loading, error } = useForms();
```

**Alternative Considered**: Redux Toolkit
